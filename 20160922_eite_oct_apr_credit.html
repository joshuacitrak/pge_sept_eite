In 2017, industrial facilities like yours will need to confirm eligibility one additional time to continue receiving this credit on your electric bill through 2020. The October credit is the first payout and retroactively covers the period of 2013-2016 if you operated in an eligible industry in those years and attested by the July 2015 deadline. If you operated in an eligible industry during 2013-2016 and attested in September 2015, this first credit will cover 2016 only.** 
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The CA Industry Assistance Credit is one of many programs resulting from landmark legislation called the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. Together, these programs are cutting pollution, creating jobs, and investing in cleaner energy and transportation.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The CPUC calculates the credit amounts for each facility using formulas which reward businesses that have taken early action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Your CA Industry Assistance Credit is designed to help compensate you for a portion of the GHG emissions costs associated with the electricity you buy. You can use the credit however you choose, but you can save money by investing in energy efficiency, including more efficient lighting, heating, and cooling.

                                    <br>
                                    <br> Please note: If your credit exceeds your monthly bill balance, you may leave the credit on your bill to use towards future energy charges or you may contact your utility to request a check for any remaining bill credit. If you were previously receiving the small business California Climate Credit, you will no longer receive the small business California Climate Credit and will now receive the annual CA Industry Assistance Credit.
